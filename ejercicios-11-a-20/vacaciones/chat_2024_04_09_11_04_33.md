This code is a part of a function that searches for a specific phrase in a larger text (stored in the variable `phrase`) and replaces it with another phrase (stored in the variable `pReplace`). Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `find != string::npos`: This part checks if the `find` variable (which presumably holds the index of the found phrase in `phrase`) is not equal to `string::npos`. If it is not equal to `string::npos`, it means that the phrase was found in the text.

2. `phrase.replace(find, searchSize, pReplace)`: If the phrase was found, this line of code replaces the found phrase in the `phrase` string starting from the index `find` and spanning `searchSize` characters with the content in the `pReplace` variable.

3. `: "No se encontro la frase buscada: " + pSearch + "\n";`: If the phrase was not found in the text, this part of the code executes. It returns a message saying "No se encontro la frase buscada: " concatenated with the `pSearch` variable (which presumably holds the phrase that was being searched) followed by a newline character `\n`.

4. Finally, the result of either the replacement or the error message is returned from the function.

In summary, this code is a simple replacement function that searches for a specific phrase in a text and replaces it with another phrase if found, or returns an error message if the phrase is not found.
